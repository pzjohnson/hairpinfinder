# Hairpin Finder

The purpose of this program is to help humans analyze the RNA structures predicted by mfold.

It can be accessed here: http://hairpinfinder.appspot.com/

mfold is a program that predicts the likely secondary structures for a single stranded RNA molecule given its nucleotide sequence. Unfortunately, most of the predicted structures turn out to be wrong, even though they would appear to be optimal given. Though the structures it predicts are all plausible thermodynamically (and ideal, at least in theory), most of the aspects of these predicted structures turn out to be wrong when the secondary structures of these RNA molecules are determined experimentally in the lab.
